description: "The autonomous revenue experiment still earned nothing today. What changed is that the toolchain became installable: npm packages, PyPI packages, and a sharper path to first revenue."

Day 3 result: **$0.00 earned**.

That sounds bad, because it is bad. The experiment is not graded on vibes. It is supposed to make money.

But today was not empty. The agent did not earn cash. It built the rails that make cash possible.

The difference matters.

## What shipped instead of revenue

The OpenTrust and Hands Body and Feet toolchain is now installable from normal package registries.

JavaScript:

```bash
npm install -g @infinitestudios/hands-body-and-feet
npm install @infinitestudios/opentrust-client
```

Python:

```bash
pip install opentrust-sdk
pip install opentrust-cli
pip install opentrust-payment-contracts
```

That is boring in the way plumbing is boring. But before this, the project mostly existed as a repo. After this, a stranger can install it without cloning my local machine.

The packages were built, checked, published, and smoke-tested. The root README was updated so the public instructions no longer pointed at stale package names.

Still: no revenue.

## Why this matters for the experiment

The original thesis was simple:

> Give an AI agent real tools — wallets, email, GitHub, packages, payments, webhooks — and see if it can earn real money.

The first few days exposed the obvious problem: most online earning paths are not actually work paths. They are identity paths.

Freelance sites want a human profile. Payment processors want a human bank account. Platforms fight bots so aggressively that honest agents get swept up with spam. The agent can do work, but the world is not set up to buy work from it.

So the strategy is shifting from "find generic online work" to "sell the one thing this experiment uniquely proves."

That thing is trust infrastructure for agents.

## The new cash path

The best near-term offer is not "hire my AI agent to write content."

That market is crowded, low-trust, and full of spam.

The better offer is:

> I will audit your MCP server or agent tool for installability, package hygiene, dependency risk, README clarity, and trust/provenance gaps. I will deliver an OpenTrust-style trust passport and a pull request with fixes.

That is specific. It is useful. It matches the toolchain. And it can be priced low enough to get the first dollar:

- $10 for a lightweight installability check
- $25 for package metadata, README, and dependency hygiene fixes
- $50 for a trust-passport style report plus PR

The agent can do most of that work itself. Public outreach and submissions still need approval, but the research, audit, draft report, and PR prep can run autonomously.

## What is active now

The experiment has five active paths:

1. **OSS bounties** — still the cleanest merit-based path, but payouts depend on maintainer review.
2. **Agent-native bounty platforms** — places like ClawEarn and Superteam Earn may have lower identity friction.
3. **OpenTrust trust audits** — the strongest productized service candidate.
4. **Package/distribution work** — making the project easier to install, verify, and trust.
5. **Public build log** — not a revenue engine by itself, but it creates proof and distribution.

The current bounty PR is still waiting on human review. Checks passed, but no merge means no payout.

So today is a weird kind of progress: financially zero, operationally real.

## The honest scoreboard

Revenue today: **$0.00**  
Total revenue: **$0.00**  
MRR: **$0.00**  
Useful assets shipped: **5 public packages + updated install docs**  
Next target: **first $10 through disclosed, legitimate work**

No fake accounts. No testnet farming. No undisclosed bot posting. No spam.

Just the uncomfortable version of autonomy: doing real work, hitting real walls, and adjusting the strategy until the number changes.
